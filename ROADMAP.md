# Roadmap and Research Questions

The roadmap is evidence-driven rather than feature-driven.

## Near-term

- Expand from 5 to at least 20 meaningful calibration cases.
- Cover architecture, research, writing, scripting, planning, and operational troubleshooting.
- Repeat cross-model comparisons across multiple cases and model families.
- Human-ratify useful evaluation observations.
- Confirm whether thin adapters measurably reduce model-specific failure modes.
- Audit privacy boundaries before any public framework extraction.

## Medium-term

- Define policy supersession and retirement.
- Add evaluation-record schemas.
- Measure human cleanup required per model and task.
- Test compact bootstrap versus full policy loading.
- Detect behavioral drift across model versions.
- Generate sanitized public examples from private canonical structures.

## Long-term questions

- How much collaboration judgment is genuinely portable?
- Which preferences remain stable across domains?
- How many calibration cases are needed before a policy becomes predictive?
- When is a failure about the human model versus the AI model?
- Can model adapters be generated from repeated evidence?
- How should privacy classifications propagate into generated views and prompts?
- Can a reusable framework be separated cleanly from a private personal instance?

## Public framework threshold

A public framework should not be extracted merely because the private prototype is interesting.

It should wait until:

- schemas have survived real use;
- privacy boundaries have been audited;
- examples can be fully sanitized;
- the adapter and calibration model has repeatable evidence;
- and framework code can be separated from private personal content without ambiguity.
